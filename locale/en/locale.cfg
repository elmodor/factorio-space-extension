[mod-setting-description]
SpaceX-research=Research cost multiplier. Defines how many research packs are required for a technology. 0.5 means 50% (half) of the original value. 2 means x2 (double) of the original research cost.
SpaceX-production=Recipe ingredient cost multiplier. Defines how many ingredient are required to craft an item. 0.5 means 50% (half) of the original value. 2 means x2 (double) of the original ingredients.
SpaceX-launch-multiplier=Component launch multiplier. Defines how many items must be delivered to complete a stage. 0.5 means 50% (half) of the original value. 2 means x2 (double) of the original items must be delivered.
SpaceX-ignore-tech-multiplier=SpaceX tech prices are fixed and unaffected by changes to the vanilla game's technology price multiplier used for marathon games.  By default this multiplier is in addition to the SpaceX research cost multiplier, so check this to vary the costs independently (makes marathon SpaceX games easier).
SpaceX-no-space-sci=By default the later SpaceX technologies requires Space Science.  Checking this setting will remove the space science requirement from the SpaceX technologies (makes game easier).
SpaceX-no-nuclear=Replaces all nuclear fuel with rocket fuel in all SpaceX recipes. Also replaces the nuclear reactor with rocket fuel (makes game easier).
SpaceX-cheaper-fusion-reactor=The recipe cost of the fusion reactor component is reduced to 40 portable fusion reactors.  This makes them cost 10k processing units (same as in v0.14) rather than 25k processing units that is the standard v0.15 cost (makes game easier).
SpaceX-no-bob=Bob's mods compatibility will not be used in this playthrough if Bob mods are used.
SpaceX-no-krastorio=Krastorio2 mods compatibility will not be used in this playthrough if Krastorio2 mods are used.
SpaceX-no-pyanodons=Pyanodons mods compatibility will not be used in this playthrough if Pyanodons mods are used.
SpaceX-no-ir=Industrial Revolution mods compatibility will not be used in this playthrough if Industrial Revolution mods are used.
SpaceX-no-popup=If selected then the narrative popups for the stage completion will be suppressed. (Good for games where you want to launch many FTL craft)
SpaceX-auto-continue=This option will automatically continue and reset the SpaceX progress when the FTL space craft has been completed.  Also the popup is suppressed - use in conjucntion with the above selection to remove the popups so you can keep launching multiple FTL spacecraft without manual intervention.
SpaceX-no-chat-msg=If selected then the chat messages for stage completion will be suppressed. (Good for games where you want to launch many FTL craft)
SpaceX-split-combinator=Splits the SpaceX combinator in two: One which outputs only the required item and a new combinator which outputs the special symbol S for the current stage.
SpaceX-log-days="2d 1h" instead of "49h"
SpaceX-ftl-ramp-up=Gradually ramp up the FTL research with science packs. If disabled, all science packs are required for all FTL technology stages.
SpaceX-classic-mode=The classic SpaceX experience. Disables stage 4 and nuclear fuel. Sets the classic research cost for the FTL technologies.
